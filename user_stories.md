# Volunteer

Alice is interested in volunteering and has some tech skills.

She comes to our site, clicks the "Interested in volunteering" button on the home page then fills in details of her bio, what she could help with and which categories of charity she wants to help.

Later she is matched with a charity looking for help, and receives an email from our system with details of what they want help with and a link to confirm she is interested in that.

She is interested so clicks the link and we pass her contact details to the charity, they get in touch and they arrange to get things done.

If she wasn't interested she could just ignore the email.

## Pause

Later Alice is busier with other stuff and doesn't want to be getting emails from us for a while so she comes back to the site, goes to her profile and clicks the pause button.

# Charity

Barry runs a charity and has a need for some help with tech stuff.

He comes to our site and clicks the "I need a volunteer" button, picks categories for what he needs help with and what his charity is, he gets a list of volunteers that match and can select one (or more) to contact.

He then enters details of what he's looking for, if there are any time restrictions etc. to send to potential volunteers.

That gets sent out to potential volunteers.

Some time later a volunteer responds that they are interested and we send Barry their contact details, he gets in touch with them and they arrange to get things done.

Barry clicks a link from his contact details email to let us know that he's got a volunteer.
